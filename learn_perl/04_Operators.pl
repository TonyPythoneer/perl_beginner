note:

只有 Miscellaneous Operators 比較特別，其他都跟大多數程式語言大同小異：

特殊符號為： `..`

@list_of_numbers = (3..10);
print "@list_of_numbers\n";      # 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

@list_of_letters = ('c'..'g');
print "@list_of_letters\n";      # c d e f g

@list_of_upper = ('R'..'V');
print "@list_of_upper\n";        # R S T U V

question:

In this exercise, you will need to loop through and print out all even numbers from the @NUMBERS array in the same order they are received. Don't print any numbers that come after 237 in the array.

$a = 5;
print "$a\n";

$a += 6;
print "$a\n";

$a *= 2;
print "$a\n";

$a += 1;
print "$a\n";

$a -= 9;
print "$a\n";

$a /= 7;
print "$a\n";
